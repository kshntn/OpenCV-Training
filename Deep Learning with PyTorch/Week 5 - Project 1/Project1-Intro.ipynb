    "Earlier, you trained CNNs on datasets of small images that were available inside torchvision. For example,  MNIST, FashionMNIST and CIFAR10 . Though a good starting point, with, these assignments lacked the complexity to tackle  real-world problems. Also, you were given most of the code and only had to add  small parts to  complete the assignment.\n",

    "**Implement a `3-class` Image Classifier, using a CNN**, on a dataset, which consists of `1000` images each of **panda, cat and dog**. We took the  dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ashishsaxena2209/animal-image-datasetdog-cat-and-panda), ande split it into `80:20` ratio for `train:validation`. To download, [**click here**](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/n5nya3g3airlub6/AACi7vaUjdTA0t2j_iKWgp4Ra?dl=1).\n",

    "1. The first is to get your hands dirty. training a neural network from scratch. Only then will you you understand how to build and train a real network on real data. You will implement everything this time - right from getting the data to analysing the final results.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. The second is to reinforce the use of the complete training pipeline that we suggested in our previous lecture.Try to stick to this pipeline every time you work on a new problem.\n"
